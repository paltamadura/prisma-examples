# REST API Example

This example shows how to implement a **REST API with TypeScript** using [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com/de/) and [Photon.js](https://photonjs.prisma.io/).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/typescript/rest-express
npm install
```

### 2. Generate Prisma Client JS

Prisma Client provides an API that's tailored to your database schema. Generate it with this CLI command:

```
npx prisma2 generate
```

> **Note**: You're using [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx) to run the Prisma Framework CLI that's listed as a development dependency in [`package.json`](./package.json). Alternatively, you can install the CLI globally using `npm install -g prisma2`. When using Yarn, you can run: `yarn prisma2 dev`.

This generates Prisma Client JS into `node_modules/@prisma/client`.

### 4. Start the REST API server

```
npm run dev
```

The server is now running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can send the API requests implemented in `index.js`, e.g. [`http://localhost:3000/feed`](http://localhost:3000/feed).

### 5. Using the REST API

#### `GET`

- `/post/:id`: Fetch a single post by its `id`
- `/feed`: Fetch all _published_ posts
- `/filterPosts?searchString={searchString}`: Filter posts by `title` or `content`

#### `POST`

- `/post`: Create a new post
  - Body:
    - `title: String` (required): The title of the post
    - `content: String` (optional): The content of the post
    - `authorEmail: String` (required): The email of the user that creates the post
- `/user`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
    - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user

#### `PUT`

- `/publish/:id`: Publish a post by its `id`

#### `DELETE`
  
- `/post/:id`: Delete a post by its `id`


## Evolving the app

Evolving the application typically requires four subsequent steps:

1. Migrating the database schema using SQL
1. Update your Prisma schema by untrospecting the database with `prisma2 introspect`
1. Generating Prisma Client to match the new database schema with `prisma2 generate`
1. Use the updated Prisma Client in your application code

For the following example scenario, assume you want to add a "profile" feature to the app where users can create a profile and write a short bio about themselves.

### 1. Change your databse schema using SQL

The first step would be to add new table, e.g. called `Profile`, to the database. In SQLite, you can do so by running the following SQL statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Profile" (
  "id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
  "bio" TEXT,
  "user" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES "User"(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

To run the SQL statement against the database, you can use the `sqlite3` CLI in your terminal, e.g.:

```bash
sqlite3 test.db \
'CREATE TABLE "Profile" (
  "id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
  "bio" TEXT,
  "user" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES "User"(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);'
```

Note that we're adding a unique constraint to the foreign key on `user`, this means we're expressing a 1:1 relationship between `User` and `Profile`, i.e.: "one user has one profile".

While your database is now is already aware of the new table, you're not yet able to perform any operations against it using Prisma Client. The next two steps will update the Prisma Client API to include operations against the new `Profile` table.

### 2. Introspect your database

The Prisma schema is the foundation for the generated Prisma Client API. Therefore, you first need to make sure the new `Profile` table is represented in it as well. The easiest way to do so is by introspecting your database:

```
npx prisma2 introspect
```

> **Note**: You're using [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx) to run the Prisma Framework CLI that's listed as a development dependency in [`package.json`](./package.json). Alternatively, you can install the CLI globally using `npm install -g prisma2`. When using Yarn, you can run: `yarn prisma2 dev`.

The `introspect` command creates a new `schema.prisma` file and renames the old `schema.prisma` to `schema.backup.prisma`. The updated `schema.prisma` now includes the `Profile` model and its 1:1 relation to `User`:

```prisma
model Post {
  author    User?
  content   String?
  id        Int     @id
  published Boolean @default(false)
  title     String
}

model User {
  email   String   @unique
  id      Int      @id
  name    String?
  posts   Post[]
  profile Profile?
}

model Profile {
  bio  String?
  id   Int     @id
  user User
}
```

### 3. Generate Prisma Client

With the updated Prisma schema, you can now also update the Prisma Client API with the following command:

```
npx prisma2 generate
```

### 4. Use the updated Prisma Client in your application code

You can now use your `PrismaClient` instance to perform operations against the `Profile` new table. Here are some examples. 

#### Create a new profile for an existing user

```ts
const profile = await prisma.profiles.create({
  data: {
    bio: "Hello World",
    user: {
      connect: { email: "alice@prisma.io" }
    }
  },
})
```

#### Create a new user with a new profile

```ts
const user = await prisma.users.create({
  data: {
    email: 'john@prisma.io',
    name: 'John',
    profile: {
      create: { 
        bio: "Hello World"
      }
    }
  },
})
```

#### Update the profile of an existing user

```ts
const userWithUpdatedProfile = await prisma.users.update({
  where: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
  data: {
    profile: {
      update: {
        bio: "Hello Friends"
      }
    }
  }
})
```
